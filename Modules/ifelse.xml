   <text>it is close to English, though you might say “otherwise” instead of “else” (but else is shorter!). There are two indented blocks: One, like in the simple if statement, comes right after the if heading and is executed when the condition in the if heading is true. In the if-else form this is followed by an else: line, followed by another indented block that is only executed when the original condition is false. In an if-else statement exactly one of two possible indented blocks is executed.</text>
